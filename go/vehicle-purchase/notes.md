I know that I am actually getting better:
```go
return (kind == "car" || kind == "truck")
```
I would have never made something like this had I not taken these exercises. 

And another benefit to this exercises that I can see is that I have learned things about go that I wouldn't have otherwise known:
```go
a_comes_before_b := "apple" < "banana" // true
b_comes_before_a := "apple" > "banana" // false
```
I didn't know that you could lexiconographically compare strings... ðŸ¤¯

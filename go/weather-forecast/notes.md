I forgot how important it is to start from a `FAIL`. And yes, a `[build failed]` does count. But more importantly we build on our failures. We work from what doesn't into what does; and more importantly, what is expected. 

I guess taking the time to explain the package in more detail is helpful. Not that I would really do that much, but it does make things more... detailed.

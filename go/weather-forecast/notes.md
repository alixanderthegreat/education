I forgot how important it is to start from a `FAIL`. And yes, a `[build failed]` does count. But more importantly we build on our failures. We work from what doesn't into what does; and more importantly, what is expected. 

I guess taking the time to explain the package in more detail is helpful. Not that I would really do that much, but it does make things more... detailed.

Oh yeah... I forgot that with statically typed languages you get the nice definitions that hover of packages, variables, types, constants... basically, you get more detail.

It does help to also read the `README.md` before getting started...

And it also helps to look over the test a little bit before getting into the exercise too far. I was intergiued by this test because of what tools it uses to determine the comments

This was the first exercise where I actually went to the package to read the documentation, at least for a moment, on what is contained in the package. `package strings` is a very useful package that I don't use all that much unless it is `strings.Contains`, which I have found particularly useful when having to determine some sub-string found in a bunch of text or some immensely large line of text. 

I imagine that it will be helpful to think a little more deeply about how to manipulate the immutable; I guess, now having said that, we can make copies of the immutable that are manipulated as we please. ðŸ¤“ 

It is nice to look over the test before beginning to see if there are commonalities as we proceed through the play. That way, we can establish some things at a higher level.

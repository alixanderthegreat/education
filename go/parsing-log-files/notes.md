I unfortunately am terrible at regexp. I am not going to lie in saying that I had to use the bot, and even then... I am not to confident in the solutions; in some ways I feel like I cheated my self... by I would have just handled those exercises differently than use regexp. I know... kind of puts me in this weird catch22:{
    "on the one hand, if I do it my way... did I learn regexp like the lesson suggests?",
    "on the other hand, if I use the bot... did I learn regexp like the lesson suggests?" 
}; in either case, I didn't learn regexp today, I only gathered a little more insight into a world of pattern recognition that I am not accustomed too nor am I looking to be at the moment.

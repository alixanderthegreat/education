The use of boolean operators is not really something that I deal with very often. I mean, yes, I do deal in what is `true` and what is `false`, but I don't build functions for the purpose of returning a boolean operator. For the most part, the kinds of functions that I find my self writing take data of one type and return the same type, but changed; or, take one type and make a new type or set some type. I can understand that it would be easier in some contexts (particularlly a game) where quickly dtermining if this or that can be done based on some other params... Anyway, I don't particularly have a lot to say on this at the moment - I will need to allow these thoughts to stew.

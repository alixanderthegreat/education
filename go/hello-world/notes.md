I love go. That's where I want to start. 

Sure, I started these exercises in `ruby/`, but I want to stress how much I love go by doing the `go` exercises as well. 

One of the first things that I noticed about this version of the `hello world` exercise is that there is a benchmark test. To be fair, I rarely, if ever, use benchmarking in my testing when using go; so it was a nice switch-up to an old favorite.

I don't like these ones where I have to define all the funcitons... but I guess, that's more of what real life is like (well, actually, you would even have a test suite to help you...)

I would say that I have gotten better; I noted that I wanted to correctly create a slice of float64 that was the same length as the slice we were processing.

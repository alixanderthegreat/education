It took some time to learn about the idea of 0th indexed items. I am not sure why that took so long to understand that the first `int` position of the index is the `origin`; which, counter-intuitive as it may seem, is the most logical position for the start of a list. Yes, it is the first/1st postion; but its index is at the origin. 

This was a particularly interesting problem simply on account of the need to append something onto the `slice`. I wasn't really expecting that, to be honest. I mean, I did read it; but I hadn't considered that it would be immediately relevant. 

This one was particularly easy, but I guess that the IDE really did most of the work here.

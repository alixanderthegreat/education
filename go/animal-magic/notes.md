I had to follow this article in order to complete the first of the functions to implement: https://yourbasic.org/golang/generate-number-random-range/
I was suprised that I wasn't able to use something like this before; at least, not with respect to the likelihood of landing a 0 versus not being able to.  

The next function was a little more difficult, generating wand energy... had to follow https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand#NormFloat64 to distribute the output within the desiredStdDev and desiredMean.

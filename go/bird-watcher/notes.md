In my initial go at this, I was suprised to find that I was making it way more complicated than it needed to be; I was having to build some weird multi-imensional slice that I was going to... it is too complicated to really pick at right now.

So what I did instead was that I figured that I would need to just determine the start and end of the slice and then do the math for what a week would be on the slice's indecies and just plug it into a for loop. But then I realized that I already had a function that could for loop the selection of the birdsperweek slice. 

It felt really good to knock that one out of the park.

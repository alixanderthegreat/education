One of the things that I have always loved about `go` is that there are less available configurations available to complete a task. Compared to something like `ruby`, or most modern programming languages, there are way fewer ways to cook the soup. In fact, I think that this is part and parcel of what makes `go` so exilierating when it comes to writing code. You can make something immensely robust and incredibly quickly because the path to actually build it is constrained against the limits of `go`. Sure, you can define default args; sure you don't have terneary operators , or syntactical implicity ... but do those really create better code? ðŸ¤· I don't rightly know, if your objective is to make construct code quickly, possibly; if you want to construct performant/maintainable code quickly, probably not. But it is hard to say, I haven't had much experience dealing with enough variety of programming languages, or constructions to rightly determine the answers.

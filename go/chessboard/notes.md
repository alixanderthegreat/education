After reviewing the community ... I was suprised by two things:
```go
type this [8]bool
        // ^ this was really interesting,
        // I have never specified the len of a slice ahead of time
```
the second, which is not as glamorous, you can use the functions that you make to... you know, solve the tests...
||big brain if you use them in your code base in general :)||

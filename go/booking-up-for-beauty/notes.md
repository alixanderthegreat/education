I would have never considered:
```go
if err == nil {
    return t
}
```
that's not how I would have done that, but when I reviewed another student's work, I thought, 'huh, that is actually really smart to expand the schedule function and then refactor the package; oh, when you don't get an error here, just return the parsed time.' ðŸ¤¦

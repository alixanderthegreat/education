I need to trust the patterns that I already know in `go`. 

I know that there are ways of doing things in ruby that are immensely esoteric, and powerful; but, I am just not going to learn those things without studying how the community does code. 
Pretty much everything will get handled in some kind of loop; if not... then... it is a conditional otherwise it is an error. I think that this pattern is so useful that I didn't create it, I simply need to emulate it as we are doing the exercises.

I guess what I liked about this exercise is that it unveiled much of the mystery regarding `:symbols`. I never say them as immutable strings, but that made a whole helluva lota sense to me once I had it explained like that. See, I live in the world of `go`, and so the idea of an immutable string only exists as a `const`. So in that way, I instantly understood what a `:sym` was, albeit there usage is a little different. You can't take a `var` in go and promote it to a `const`, that's like... not a thing: `ILLEGAL`. Jk, it is probably just a compiler error wherein a `const` can't be a `var`. But in `rb` you can take a string and make operate it into an immutable, eg a `const` of sorts. Anyway, I think I have allayed the picture well enough, and so I enjoyed the ideas well enough.
